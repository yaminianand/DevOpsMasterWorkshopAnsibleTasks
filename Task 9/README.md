I had to fork the repo to make some changes to playbook source location since my workspace name is different than what was in the playbook as I named my job differently that is not spring_petclinic. This was giving error as it was building in one location and looking for the jar in some other location and that got resolved with updating the src in the playbook. Also, the master branch was checked out always and have to comment that git command in the checkoout stage and this helped the job config to take over which checked out the deploy branch as confiured in the job. That is the reason you will see some commits in the screen shot that I attached.
